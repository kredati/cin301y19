# Revisions to CIN301
## In the wake of social distancing & distance learning measures responding to Covid-19

### tl;dr
Scott is proposing changes to CIN301 that require a student vote.
* You can vote [here](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/quizzes/62095).
* The most important changes: 
  * cancel the exam
  * re-weight the paper marking to be more generous
  * re-weight the tutorial marking to be more generous

That said, please do read this whole document as carefully as you can. Or: [skip to the detailed changes affecting marks](#proposed-changes).

Edited to add: 51 students (more than a majority of the enroled 96) have voted, every one in favour of the proposed changes. The ayes have it. **The proposed changes to CIN301 have been approved, and are now in effect.** Thank you to everybody who has voted, and quickly. I will leave the vote open through March 24, and will continue to collect and consult the feedback in the second, open-ended question.

### Preamble
The principles behind this revision are simple: we are aiming to meet the [course objectives](https://github.com/kredati/cin301y19/blob/master/syllabus.md#course-description) while providing as much flexibility in coursework as we can. People are in a variety of different situations, both academically and personally. Your TAs and I have devised a revision to the coursework and marking scheme that continues academic integrity while also providing for flexibility.

Your priority at this moment of crisis should be to stay healthy, stay safe, and care for yourself and your loved ones. Do that. But also, we're dedicated to providing a reasonable degree of continuity of instruction: your TAs and I will keep working for you.

### Guiding principles
The four guiding principles here are:
* School is not your highest priority. I am certain that what little scintillating brilliance I have to offer is nowhere near the most important thing in your life right now. I am also certain that your work for me under crisis conditions will not entail very much good learning. I will do everything I can to ensure that CIN301 will not stand in the way of anybody graduating this spring.

* Accessibility in a crisis. Everybody's lives just got turned upside down---and that's the best case scenario. I want everything we do to be accessible to everybody, including people whose lives are in heightened or intensifying crisis. I am making policy changes that cover everybody in the course as though students face only mild-to-moderate logistical difficulties. If you get sick, if a loved one gets sick, if your logistical difficulties overwhelm, please let me know about it---only as soon as your capacity to prioritize school shows back up. I will modify course parameters early and often, or late and retrospectively, for people facing exacerbated crisis for whatever reason.

* Acknowledgment of crisis. Any attempt to reproduce regular learning, especially but not only maintaing structures of obligation of students to courses, is bound to fail. Because of that, I am planning to waive all further requirements in CIN301 excepting the fourth paper (much more on that below). That said, the situation is fluid, and our current plan is only current. I will maintain as much early transparent communication as I can.

* A single source of truth. I'm sorry this document is so detailed, but rather than trying to update multiple sources with each change to our situation, this will be the document _all of us_ work from: Scott, your TAs, you.

### This document
This is the governing document on changes to the course in light of social distancing & distance learning measures put in place by U of T. What is here supersedes anything in the course syallbus or on the Quercus site, or even personal communication from Scott before March 16. The situation is, still, quite fluid. Quercus is also very slow to send notification emails at the moment. To stay up to date, please save this URL, and check back regularly for any updates---especially as Quercus is (as of March 16) overwhelmed and not sending emails in a timely manner.

### Asking questions, seeking clarity
I will offer what clarity I can, but the situation is very fluid. I beg your patience.

Please direct questions to our Quercus discussion boards.

Anything related to our learning technology (including troubleshooting the tech) and the fate of instruction should be directed to [the discussion board for online learning logistics](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/discussion_topics/558495).

Anything related to our assignments or changes to the marking scheme---and, well, discussing anything related to the radical upheaval of our lives currently ongoing---should go in [the discussion board for assignment logistics](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/discussion_topics/558490).

### Voting on changes
U of T stipulates that changes to the marking scheme must be approved by a vote of the students, with at least a week to consider the changes. This document outlines the proposed changes. The vote will remain open between noon on Monday, March 16, through Tuesday, March March 24. Please vote if you can.

The vote for the changes detailed below is open at https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/quizzes/62095. It will remain open until 11:59pm (EDT) on Tuesday, April 24. A majority vote of the students voting will carry; there are no quorum requirements. That said, **_please, please vote_**. 

Edited to add: the vote is still open, but a majority of students in CIN301 have already voted in favour of the proposed changes below. You may still submit both a vote, until 11:59pm on March 24, and also fill out the open-ended question of what you'd like to tell Scott anonymously.

### Changes to instruction
These changes do not require action on your part. Instruction is now entirely optional, online, asyncrhonous, and text-based. The balance of the course material is enrichment to the 21 weeks we had together before the pandemic. That said, for students wanting to engage course material, here is what you can expect:

* A prose "lecture" will be posted each week by end-of-day Tuesday in https://github.com/kredati/cin301y19/tree/master/online_learning.
* There are online sources for our films & media for the balance of the term. Some of them are not free. Watch what you want & can afford. I also understand that students returning home to other countries may face location-based copyright restrictions that make these materials unavailable. This material is entirely optional. The sources I have located are noted in the [course schedule](https://github.com/kredati/cin301y19/blob/master/schedule.md).
* From noon–1pm (EDT) on Monday and noon-3pm (EDT) on Wednesday, I will be online doing close-to-real-time reddit AMA-style responses to our course discussion board on Quercus. These will be open reasonably ahead of time so you can post to them beforehand (especially but not only if you're in a timezone other than EDT). I will respond to as much as I can synchronously, and will address what I can't get to either in asynchronous discussion-board posting, or in the subsequent "lecture."
* Your tutorial sections will have a similar format: each of your TAs will open a discussion board on your tutorial section's Quercus site, and will be doing close-to-real-time reddit AMA-style responses to that discussion board. That said, they will open these discussions not later than 5pm (EDT) on Wednesday, to allow students in other time zones to participate asynchronously; questions can be posted ahead of time. These sessions will take place during your tutorials, but will start at quarter past the hour and continue to the end of the hour (e.g., 2:15–3pm). Your TAs will also respond to the discussion board at a second time during the week to respond to any posts they didn't get to, or posts that came in late. I will do my best to synthesize and address any unanswered questions on tutorial boards in my "lecture."
* Your TA will hold an additional online tutorial session on Thursday, April 2 or Friday, April 3. This will be a kind of final review/check-in session.
* Any questions about the logistics of online instruction can be addressed to https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/discussion_topics/558495.

### Changes to marking
#### Status quo ante: what we ~~are (hopefully) dispensing~~ have dispensed with with
The current marking scheme is detailed in our [syllabus](./syllabus.md). That said, here's the breakdown:
* 25% final exam.
* 65% four papers, each worth 16.25%.
* 10% tutorial question marks, calculated as follows: for each question asked during the formal question period at the beginning of tutorial, a student gets a chit. The mark is the percentage of 10 chits the student accrues, up to but not greater than 100, (e.g. 6 questions = 60%; 12 questions = 100%).

The current schedule is also detailed in our syllabus:
* The fourth paper was to be due Wednesday, April 1, 2020. 
* The final exam was to take place 9am-12noon on Saturday, April 25.

#### What will stay the same
* There are no late penalties, ever, in CIN301.
* Students may still revise and resubmit one of their first three papers. Resubmissions should be sent to Scott by email by 12noon on April 25, 2020.
* Students must still submit all four papers in CIN301 to pass the course. That said, Scott will be very flexible and reasonable about accommodations, especially (but not only) when considering questions of disruption to daily life, illness on the part of students or their family (chosen or of origin), and so on. The guiding principle here, as elsehwere, is: take care of your human and personal priorities first; school comes second.
* Students are still only eligible to receive comments on only one of their papers marked during the fourth and final marking window. (That said, this marking window will, if the changes below are approved, now close April 25.)
* To receive comments on any papers submitted after March 2, students must request those comments in a "submission comment" in Quercus when they turn their papers in.
* I reserve the right to introduce a correction of some kind---on assignments, on grades as a whole---to ensure the median mark for CIN301 is fair, especially under the circumstances. This correction will only ever work in students' favor; I will _never_ curve grades downward.

#### ~~Proposed c~~ Changes now in effect
##### Changes to marking scheme
**_Please vote to approve, or not, these changes [here](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/quizzes/62095) by 11:59pm on Tuesday, April 24._**

_Questions about the below should be posted to [our discussion board dedicated to assignment logistics](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/discussion_topics/558490)._

Edited to add: the vote is positive; the changes below are now in effect. That said, you may still submit your votes (including anything anonymous you'd like to communicate to Scott) until 11:59pm on March 24. The discussion board remains open to ask questions or address issues with the proposed changes.

* The final exam, originaly worth 25% of your final mark, is canceled.
* The four papers, taken together, are now worth 90% of your final mark. Of that 90%, here is the breakdown:
  * Three of the papers will each be worth 18% of your final mark.
  * One of the papers will be worth 36% of your final mark.  
  * The paper with the double weight will be the one on which you receive your best mark from your papers across the year. For example, if you have an A, two B+'s, and a C, the A paper would count for 36%; the other three (C, B+, B+) would count for 18%. (Recall that you should be thinking about your papers in terms of letter marks based in our weird grading system: a 6/10 is not a 60 but rather a B, which correlates to a 75 in U of T's normal marking system.) This weighting will, of course, take into account any revised & resubmitted papers.
* The tutorial mark will still count for 10% of your final mark. That said, given the changes to instruction, we will calculate your mark using a different algorithm:
  * The tutorial mark will now be re-scaled, so the lowest possible mark is 50, and the highest 100.
  * Last week's tutorial, the screening of _K3G_, is a freebie for everybody.
  * The the last two regularly scheduled tutorials, being optional, have been taken off the table. The mark will now be the perecentage of 8 tutorials at which you asked questions, scaled between 50 and 100. Each question is now worth 6.25 points added to 50, up to 100, rounded to the nearest whole point.
  * That said, your participation in the final 3 weeks of tutorial (note the additional tutorial we have added) will still accrue marks. Any posting of any kind (a question or a response) on any discussion board (either Scott's or your TA's) will count as a chit for the purposes of counting up of participation marks. That said, you still get only one chit per week no matter how many things you post.
  * This is a slightly complex algorithm, so here are some examples:
  * If you've asked 8 or more questions, that is obviously 100.
  * If you have asked 7 questions, that is also 100 (7 questions + 1 _K3G_ = 8; 8/8 = 100%).
  * If you have asked 0 questions, that is now 56: 50 + ([0 + 1] * 6.25) = 56.25 -> 56.
  * If you have asked 3 questions, that is now 75: 50 + ([3 + 1] * 6.25) = 75.
  
##### Concrete changes not directly affecting the marking scheme
These are not up for a vote directly, but they follow from the proposed changes to the marking scheme. They will be put in place if and only if the class approves the changes above.
* Students must still submit a fourth paper, but the due date for that paper is now 12noon on Saturday, April 25---the end time of our originally scheduled exam. Hopefully, that gives students enough time to settle into their new normals.
* Tutorials, like other instruction, will continue to take place---but are now optional. (That said, they can still be used to improve your mark if that seems important to you.)
* For the 3rd paper, I am not waiving students' obligation to talk to me before submitting very late papers, but I am giving students a grace period of an additional week before that obligation kicks in. If you submit the 3rd paper after 11:59pm on Monday, ~~April~~ March 23, you must talk to me to discuss your situation before that paper can be counted as submitted. If you submit your paper before then, it will simply be counted as turned in, and will be marked with the fourth batch of papers.
