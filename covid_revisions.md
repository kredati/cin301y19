# Revisions to CIN301
## In the wake of social distancing measures responding to Covid-19

### Preamble
The principles behind this revision are simple: we are aiming to meet the [course objectives](https://github.com/kredati/cin301y19/blob/master/syllabus.md#course-description) while providing as much flexibility in coursework as we can. People are in a variety of different situations, both academically and personally. Your TAs and I have devised a revision to the coursework and marking scheme that continues academic integrity while also providing for flexibility.

The course will have to vote on any changes to the marking scheme. This document outlines the proposed changes.
