# Globalization and Bollywood
## Or, capitalism and the nation

### Logistics
I am still working out synchronous and/or asynchronous replacements for lectures and tutorials. I am also working to figure out what to do for screenings, should I have to cancel them. Please stay tuned for announcements regarding Monday's meeting.

#### Attendance and absence
There is no need to bother with the new absence protocol in CIN301. Attendance is neither taken nor required at lecture, and we will have an online replacement for tutorials in-place by a week from tomorrow.

#### Streaming replacements for screenings
* _Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham..._ (or _K3G_) is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video, which gives you free access for 6 months with a student email address.
* I have not found a place to stream _Akira_ legally. This serves as the one-week notice that I am replacing _Akira_ with _Ghost in the Shell_ (_Kôkaku Kidôtai_, Japan, 1995, 83 min.). _Ghost in the Shell_ is rentable from iTunes for $3.99. (And if you want to watch _Akira_, go ahead with that.)
* _I Am Love_ is also rentable from iTunes for $3.99.
* For the last week of class, _I Love Alaska_ is available as a YouTube playlist at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66D276282DFDA6A5. I am cancelling _My Best Thing_. Please watch Miranda July's [Somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz13HMsvb6o) in its stead. Thompson + Craighead's _Beacon_ is up at http://automatedbeacon.net.

### Introduction
Bollywood is our case study for what happens with the recent globalization of the film industry. It is an interesting case for a few reasons:
* India's film industry only became open to international finance capital in the 1990s. Globalization is a recent phenomenon for Indian films.
* India's Hindi-language film industry explicitly targets India's multi-lingual and multi-ethnic global diaspora, so-called NRI's, or non-resident Indians.
* Hindi-language films have occasionally seen unexpected and extraordinary success in non-Indian contexts.
* Historically (before the 1990s), Hindi-language film in India has been an important institution in post-colonial nation-building project, solidifying identification with the Hindu-majority (but multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious) state by means of cinematic identification.
* Because of the previous points, recent Hindi-language Indian film (Bollywood, more or less) has a complex and conflicted relationship to the Indian national project, especially as India embraced liberalisation and global capitalism in the 1990s and the horizon for nation-building expanded beyond the borders of India.

This complex relationship, seen from inside India and its film industry (as narrated in Rajadhyaksha), and seen from the US American and more generally the West (as told by Joshi), is the topic of our two readings for this week. This complex and conflicted relationship should organize how we understand _K3G_, which has a fairly dizzying set of ideologies related to nationhood, family, romantic love, global capitalism, consumerism, diaspora, and so on.

In particular, you should be paying attention to, and thinking through, these ideologies and especially the formal and narrative dynamics of identification.

### On the nature of globalization
Our current political–economic regime is, broadly speaking, _neoliberalism_, which has been the reigning form of political economy globally since around 1980. One of the more important aspects in neoliberalism is the removal of barriers to the free flow of capital. Institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the World Trade Organization have used a variety of policy levers to encourage, coerce, or force countries to open their borders to the flows of international finance capital. India liberalised its economy in the 1990s, sector-by-sector. (I have a dear friend who grew up in India from a young age, as her father was one of the first Pepsi executives to move to India.) India is not alone in opening its borders to the flow of international finance capital since 1980, but what happened to its cinema is at once relatively unique and also instructive.

Because of the (neo)liberalisation of the Indian economy, domestic industries, including cinema, received much higher levels of international investment starting in the mid-1990s. This also meant that they were expected to make much more money---that is, to sell many more tickets. In the case of film, more financing was available, both to the industry as a whole and to individual films; but this increased funding meant that films now had to make more money at the box office.

What Rajadhyaksha calls "Bollywoodization" is at once the aesthetic, cultural, and economic response to the liberalisation of the Indian film industry starting in 1992.

### What is a national cinema?
As both Rajadhyaksha and Jsohi point out, the Indian film industry---in Hindi film production and in many other languages besides---had long been part of the project of Indian nation-building. 

The current nation of India was brought into being in 1947 when it gained independence from Great Britain, whose colonial holdings were [partitioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India) into what is now India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The partition was (among other things; history is complicated) devised to create a majority Mulsim state (Pakistan, which originally included both Pakistan and Bangladesh [East Pakistan]) and a majority Hindu state, India.

Cinema in India after 1947 became an important "mediating institution" of post-colonial Indian nation-building. It was not state-supported or state-run, but nevertheless served as a horizon for collective Indian experience for a very broad swathe of Indian life. As Joshi points out, Indian cinema still routinely plays in huge "picture palace"-type theatres, which bring (and brought!) together a great many different different sorts of people from different castes, economic classes, ethnic backgrounds, etc.

Effectively, Indian cinema had for a long time been made by Indian directors and studios for Indian audiences---including in many different languages. It was a non-state actor in elaborating and solidifying identification with the idea of an Indian nation, which was, after all, a creation of British colonialism (or rather, its demise).

### What is Bollywoodization?
Rajadhyaksha develops an idea of "Bollywoodization." Bollywoodization is the process by which the Indian national project gets routed through the circuits of global capital. Bollywood comes to stand in for an Indian-ness whose horizon is now less citizens of India living in India, but rather the global stage. Rajadhyaksha's best example of this is Rajnikant: he is a Tamil film star; he makes it big in Japan; he then becomes a more national hero in Indian life more generally. Global success becomes important as a national phenomenon.

Bollywoodization, in other words, names the process by which global capital skims off some of the most commercially successful material and sells it to the world as a kind of gauzy, generalized "Indian-ness." Bollywoodization is necessary because the new financial environment, now open to global capital, requires higher rates of return. And it effects the way nationhood is articulated by a film industry that had always been important for elaborating a shared national project. The new Indian nationhood of Bollywodization is compatible with diaspora, wealth, flashy consumption of global brands---that is to say, with globalized neoliberalism.

### _K3G_ and Bollywoodization
Joshi, speaking a language of "Bollylite," but who is largely in agreement with Rajadhyaksha, out that _K3G_ is the epitome of this kind of process. It offers an Indian-ness that is nearly devoid of content other than sentimental family melodrama and flashy consumerism. It is also carefully calibrated to appeal to NRI's, who might see their experience reflected in _K3G_'s sequences in London. Moreover, it laminates an appeal to family sentinmentality to an appeal to a diffusely patriotic (if consumerist) attachment to Indian-ness. You can be Indian even if you don't live in India, so long as you love your parents. (After all, it's all about loving your parents---although we never, quite, know what "it" is.)

Joshi's excellent discussion of _K3G_ runs from 251–54, which you should read either before or after watching the film.

This is the background for understanding _K3G_, what it's doing, and how we're watching it.

### Concluding thoughts
I want to connect this discussion of _K3G_ and neoliberal globalization to a few earlier moments in the course:
* Consider the ideology and identification _K3G_ solicits. Joshi invokes Metz explicitly, but also consider the Althusserian overtones: how does _K3G_ collapse the distance between different ideological apparatuses, like the State and the Family?
* Consider also the ways in which _K3G_ elaborates an idea of the nation in relation to what films like _Daisies_ and _Hour of the Furnaces_. Note the de-politicized, fully capitalistic, largely cosmopolitan idea here.
* Finally, think carefully about the distinction we drew last week between audiences and spectators. How does the discussion of globalization, NRI's, and global marketing inflect or change the ways we understand audience and spectator? What are the horizons of reception we might need to bring to bear, if we want to understand how a film like _K3G_, with its nearly unimaginably broad audience, circulates and means?
