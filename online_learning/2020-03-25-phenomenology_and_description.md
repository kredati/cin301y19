### On phenomenology & description
More than the specific details of Sontag's essay, or Sobchack's theories, or Latour's worries about critique, the material in this week of the course offers a pointed alternative to a great deal of film theory as we have seen it so far.
* Apparatus theory, recall, speaks a language of the unconscious: that which is not amenable to, or available to, introspection and experience.
* For psychoanalytic film theory in particular, the "spectator" is an ideal position--a subject position--and not an empirical reality.
* Your individual acts of film viewing are organized by a very-often-unconscious relation both to the cinematic apparatus itself and the particular structures of looking and desiring set in motion by a particular film.
* Even the responses to apparatus theory and psychoanalytical film theory, such as Shaviro or hooks, still play out at this particular level.

In Sontag's terms, apparatus theory is an iteration of the project of interpretation: a search for a latent meaning that is hidden behind a text. That hidden meaning requires the procedures of analysis and interpretation to be brought to light. And, that hidden meaning is understood to be the "real" or "true" meaning of the text.

In other terms, we would say that interpretation belongs to the "hermeneutics of suspicion" (Paul Ricoeur) or to "paranoid reading" (Eve Sedgwick). Whether suspicion or paranoia: the idea is that the real story is _always_ somewhere other than in plain sight, and that it requires the activity of forensics or theory (or, theory-as-forensics) to discover that real story.

Phenomenology, and description, are important critical and intellectual responses to the positions and practices of interpretation--of suspicion, of paranoia. They insist (for various reasons) that the important work to be done is to intensify our awareness of and attention to encounters with things.

These positions--advocating for description & phenomenology--are, in important ways, consonant with the project of aesthetic criticism in Cavell. The primary activity that Cavell & Sontag & Sobchack want us to engage in is: describe an experience so fully that your reader can share in it.

So, let's take these positions in turn: what they don't like about interpretation/suspicion/paranoia, and what they propose in their stead.

### Susan Sontag: Against Interpretation
This is one of the more important essays written in American aesthetic theory. It is of a piece with "Notes on Camp," which you'll remember from September. Sontag was queer, if closeted, and her gloss on camp's sensibility of attending to the artifice of things, or of things as artifice, is an iteration of a more general project of attending more closely to the surfaces of things--and of art.

The most important slogan here is: "In place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art" (14). By this she means: a critical practice that does not search for meaning, but rather intensifies the sensuous impact of the work of art as much as possible.

This slogan immediately follows a passage that pulls everything in this essay together: "What is important right now is to recover our senses. We must learn to to _see_ more, to _hear_ more, to _feel_ more.... The function of criticism is to show _how it is what it is_, even _that it is what it is_, rather than to show _what it means_" (14).

The idea here is that Sontag is calling for a critical practice that searches not for the meaning of the work, but for a way to express the _feeling_ the work gives. We could call the target the sensuous or erotic impact of the work.

Think here about the ways in which _I Am Love_ makes literal erotic sensual intensification continuous with other forms of sensuality: the taste of food, the contact between bodies, the beauty of architecture.

Sontag doesn't call it this, but for our purposes: the critical practice Sontag calls for is a kind of _description_.

Sontag's distaste for interpretation isn't a rejection of meaning, quite. Certainly not a reject of meaning for all people at all times in front of all works of art. Rather, for her, we have (already in 1964!) gotten too comfortable with interpretation, of substituting our experience of an encounter with a work of art, with an elaboration of the meaning of a work. Interpretation takes us away from from the work; interpretation is "the revenge of the intellect upon the world" (7)--and the work. Intellect stands itself up as the only faculty capable of really reckoning with the world.

So Sontag doesn't deny that there are works of art that call out for interpretation, that invite the discovery or elaboration of a hidden meaning. She thinks those works aren't vital, or important. And she doesn't deny that interpretation can be profitably practiced on many works of art (although abstract work--like Barnett Newman's paintings or John Whitney's films--pretty successfully resist meaning).

Instead, she's making a local value judgment: we moderns suffer from the hypertrophe of the intellect. We do too much interpretation, and not enough _feeling_. The critic's task, now, should be to inflame feeling, to elaborate and intensify our capacity to come alive to the sensuous intensity of the world.

In other words, to follow in Tilda Swinton's footsteps in _I Am Love_.

### Sobchack: For phenomenology
Vivian Sobchack is the leading phenomenologist of the cinema. I answered a question about what phenomenology is on Monday's discussion board. Here's what I wrote:

> My take on the strict sense of phenomenology is that it refers to a particular tradition in Continental/European philosophy that is grounded in the work of a fairly small set of philosophers: Edmund Husserl is the real founder of the movement; Martin Heidegger its most famous exponent; and Jean-Paul Sartre its popularizer. Other people deeply associated with the phenomenological tradition include Maurice Merleau-Ponty (whose philosophy is of particular interest to me), Hans-Georg Gadamer (who was a student of Heidegger's, and whose approach to hermeneutics is explicitly phenomenological), and Jacques Derrida (whose early work is a continual engagement with Husserl).

> The more general sense (the sense in which Vivian Sobchack and I are phenomenologists) is a style of explication that is grounded in a practice of the description of first-person experience. Description is not the only tool that such phenomenology has, but it is its most fundamental tool. So we can see how, in this sense, "What My Fingers Knew" is an act of phenomenology: Sobchack grounds her account in a description, with as much detail as she can muster, her experience of Campion's The Piano. Indeed, she does a lot more than description, But the description she gives is both what she is trying to explainâ€”and so also what puts limits on her speculative theorizing.

> So, to put it concisely: phenomenology is a name for the commitment to the idea that philosophy, and film studies, ought to be grounded in first-person experience and its description.

> And, we might distinguish the phenomenological position, importantly, from psychoanalytical approaches, which insist that the cinema operates in ways that are never apprehensible in experience, and so speak of domains that must be arrived at analytically, and not descriptively. (That said, you might recall that Jean-Louis Baudry spends a fair amount of time on Husserl and his philosophy in "Ideological Effects of the Basic Cinematographic Apparatus.")

To this account, I want to add a few specific notes to Sobchack's particular account:
* One of her foundational postures is to frame the encounter between viewer and film as one that is essentially _intersubjective_. The film is a subject, you are a subject: the encounter, then, is a negotiation or conversation, between two subjects.
* Her claim that the film is a subject is a highly counterintuitive one. I won't rehearse her whole argument here--it is technical and complex--but she means it quite literally. (In fact, she has a chapter in her book, _The Address of the Eye_, called "Film's Body," which claims that films each literally have and live a body.) That said, one way to understand this as not-quite-as-bonkers-as-it-may-sound is to recall that apparatus theory asks us to imagine that we identify with the cinema, with films, with characters: none of these are people, but if we _identify_ with them, that suggests that we have a relationship to them that is at least in some important ways like our relationships to other people.
* That said, her insistence on the intersubjective nature of film viewing is a pointed rejection of--and reversal of--the basic dynamic of apparatus theory. Baudry and Metz and others basically construe the cinema as a machine that works on its viewers as an object. The cinema _does something to_ its spectators.
* For Sobchack, the cinema is a site of intersubjective negotiation between film and viewer. It's a much happier, friendlier account of cinemagoing.
* That said, she still shares some interesting figures from apparatus theory:
  * Her account of coenesthesia is interesting here. Her "cinesthetic" subject is a subject that is subject to coenesthesia: the primordial indifferentiation of the senses. Sobchack argues, then, that in its coenesthesia, the cinema regresses its viewers to an infantile state, and re-organizes our perceptual processes in ways that resemble the early stages of infantile development. 
  * This is a direct recapitulation of Metz's figure whereby the cinema regresses its viewers to a state of "a primitive indifferentiation of the ego and non-ego," e.g. life before the mirror stage.
  * There are important differences! But this idea of regression is a common thread. Much of what Sobchack does with phenomenology is to rework apparatus and psychoanalytic theory term-by-term, with different emphases and specifics.
  
Ultimately, Sobchack's most important innovation is to insert into film theory a dedication to the description of first-person experience: her ultimate target is to describe, and to explain, "what her fingers knew"--her experience, that is, in the opening moments of Campion's _The Piano_. She will go on to talk about meaning (meaning for her is always sensually embodied, and sensual embodiment is always a kind of meaning), and will absolutely use theory that does not belong to her first-person experience. But: both the ground and the target of the theorizing will always be first-person experience, described as closely as possible. (Those of you paying particular attention at home will notice the resemblance between Sobchack's procedure and Gadamer's hermeneutics; that is because Gadamer's hermeneutics is a form of phenomenology.)
