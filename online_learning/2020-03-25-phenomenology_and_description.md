# Phenomenology & Description
#### March 25, 2020

You can find the March 25 discussion [here](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/discussion_topics/593218).

### Logistics
* I have posted the [Paper 4 prompt](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/assignments/313930) online. It is due by 12 noon on Saturday, April 25. If you have specific questions about the prompt, please post them in the [Assignments discussion board](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/114159/discussion_topics/558490). That said, I'll certainly field any questions in today's Q&A.
* People wanting or needing to talk to me in office hours should make office hours appointments in exactly the same way they have been doing all year: https://calendly.com/s-richmond/officehours. Note that all times are Eastern (EDT). If you cannot make any of the available times, then you should email me, proposing times to meet.
* If you have already turned in paper 3, you are not required to meet with me to get your paper marked. If you have not yet turned it in, you are indeed required to have a conversation with me. Keep working, and don't let a conversation with me stand in your way of making progress on the paper.
* For any students, in any situations: I remain available to you to discuss your process, or any substantive questions or concerns you have about your paper.

### On phenomenology & description
More than the specific details of Sontag's essay, or Sobchack's theories, or Latour's worries about critique, the material in this week of the course offers a pointed alternative to a great deal of film theory as we have seen it so far.
* Apparatus theory, recall, speaks a language of the unconscious: that which is not amenable to, or available to, introspection and experience.
* For psychoanalytic film theory in particular, the "spectator" is an ideal position--a subject position--and not an empirical reality.
* Your individual acts of film viewing are organized by a very-often-unconscious relation both to the cinematic apparatus itself and the particular structures of looking and desiring set in motion by a particular film.
* Even the responses to apparatus theory and psychoanalytical film theory, such as Shaviro or hooks, still play out at this particular level.

In Sontag's terms, apparatus theory is an iteration of the project of interpretation: a search for a latent meaning that is hidden behind a text. That hidden meaning requires the procedures of analysis and interpretation to be brought to light. And, that hidden meaning is understood to be the "real" or "true" meaning of the text.

In other terms, we would say that interpretation belongs to the "hermeneutics of suspicion" (Paul Ricoeur) or to "paranoid reading" (Eve Sedgwick). Whether suspicion or paranoia: the idea is that the real story is _always_ somewhere other than in plain sight, and that it requires the activity of forensics or theory (or, theory-as-forensics) to discover that real story.

Phenomenology, and description, are important critical and intellectual responses to the positions and practices of interpretation--of suspicion, of paranoia. They insist (for various reasons) that the important work to be done is to intensify our awareness of and attention to encounters with things.

These positions--advocating for description & phenomenology--are, in important ways, consonant with the project of aesthetic criticism in Cavell. The primary activity that Cavell & Sontag & Sobchack want us to engage in is: describe an experience so fully that your reader can share in it.

So, let's take these positions in turn: what they don't like about interpretation/suspicion/paranoia, and what they propose in their stead.
