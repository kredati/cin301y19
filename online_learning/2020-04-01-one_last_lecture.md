# CIN301: A final lecture
## Networked life, and the course as a whole

### Logistics
* Just a friendly reminder that all our policy updates are collected in a single-source-of-truth document, [Covid-19 Revisions](https://github.com/kredati/cin301y19/blob/master/covid-19_revisions.md). If you have any policy or logistical questions that need answering, consult that document first.
* Course evaluations: Please do fill them out online. I take what you say seriously.
* But more importantly: I will be sending around a supplementary TA evaluation survey. Please do fill that out; it's more important for them to get that information than for me.
* Finally: when you fill out course evaluations, a few guidelines--not just for CIN301 but more broadly: 
  - Please conduct your review with respect to how much you learned, not how much fun you had or how much you liked the instructor. This is because:
  - The evidence shows that women, queers, and people of colour get systematically lower evaluation scores than white men. Now that you know about this bias, please fill out your surveys with this in mind.
  - It is never appropriate to comment on an instructor's appearance in your evaluations. _Every single one_ of my women colleagues get routine comments on their appearance; I have never received one.
  - Evaluations are especially consequential for pre-tenure, graudate, and contract faculty. (I am tenured, as of this year; they no longer matter so very much for me--although, as I said, I do take them very seriously.) Please know that you have a fair amount of power in these, and wield that power judiciously.
* I am (again), later than I'd like with this lecture. I will be responding to today's discussion board through the beginning of next week.
