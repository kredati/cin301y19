# CIN301: A penultimate lecture
## Networked life

### Logistics
* Just a friendly reminder that all our policy updates are collected in a single-source-of-truth document, [Covid-19 Revisions](https://github.com/kredati/cin301y19/blob/master/covid-19_revisions.md). If you have any policy or logistical questions that need answering, consult that document first.
* Course evaluations: Please do fill them out online. I take what you say seriously.
* But more importantly: I will be sending around a supplementary TA evaluation survey. Please do fill that out; it's more important for them to get that information than for me.
* Finally: when you fill out course evaluations, a few guidelines--not just for CIN301 but more broadly: 
  - Please conduct your review with respect to how much you learned, not how much fun you had or how much you liked the instructor. This is because:
  - The evidence shows that women, queers, and people of colour get systematically lower evaluation scores than white men. Now that you know about this bias, please fill out your surveys with this in mind.
  - It is never appropriate to comment on an instructor's appearance in your evaluations. _Every single one_ of my women colleagues get routine comments on their appearance; I have never received one.
  - Evaluations are especially consequential for pre-tenure, graudate, and contract faculty. (I am tenured, as of this year; they no longer matter so very much for me--although, as I said, I do take them very seriously.) Please know that you have a fair amount of power in these, and wield that power judiciously.
* I am (again), later than I'd like with this lecture. I will be responding to today's discussion board through the beginning of next week.
* I will be holding regular office hours next week, on Tuesday, April 7. Book an appointment, as usual, at https://calendly.com/s-richmond/officehours. After that, I will definitely be available for any kind of meeting; just email me and set up an appointment. Office hours and other appointments will be norally be conducted on video chat, by Skype; but I will do what I can to use your preferred medium (from voice call [I still have a landline] to the video chat platform of your dreams). That said, I will insist on some form of interactivity: please do not plan on using email as a replacement for meeting with me.

### Networked life
This last unit of the course is much more geared towards my current research than much of what we've done. It's definitely not film studies in a medium-specific way. 

But it is deeply continuous with the project of film theory across much of its historical span, from the 1920s through the 1980s, and even more recently.

Film theory in its guise of apparatus theory and after--but also, importantly, in the work of thinkers from the "classical" era, like Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer and André Bazin--has been concerned with developing accounts of how the cinema worked as a machine for making up subjects. The cinema affects us, often on levels that aren't consciously available. It does so politically. It teaches us what a person is and how to orient ourselves in the world. It teaches us how to live in relation to larger forces. For most of the history of film theory, film theorists understood the cinema to be the most important such political technology.

TV was super important, too. But for various reasons, film theory never took television very seriously.

In 2020, it's clear that the most important political technologies for articulating structures of subjectivity are networked computational media. The work from this week--_I Love Alaska_, _Somebody_, _Beacon_, the Galloway and Cohen and Fisher--are all trying to reckon with always-on networked computing as a technology for the production of subjects.

The most important thing to understand about the material this week is really that it's a version of apparatus theory for a present moment lived now much more in relation to networked computational media than in relation to feature-length narrative.

The second most important thing to understand about the material this week is that it has a story about how computational media address us that is decisively different than film theory's story about how films address us.

### Galloway, "Networks"
This is a difficult piece; I'm sorry for that. But it has a few important moments that I want us to learn from.

The most important such momment comes at the bottom of 290, onto 291: "a new model of reading will have to be explored, one that is not hermeneutic in nature but instead based on cybernetic parsing, scanning, rearranging, filtering, and interpolating. This new model will need to be based on an immanent or machinic notion of software. The question is not simply _logos_ (discourse) but _ergon_ (work). Networks are not simply textual entities, they are entities in a constant labor with themselves."

This should remind you of last week's reading on description: it is a call to move away from a reading practice concerned with _meaning_. In place of the phenomenologist's insistence on beginning with a first-person account, however, Galloway wants us to move away from meaning to be able to focus on _work_.

The question for networked media, for Galloway, is not _What does it mean?_, but rather: _What does it do? How does it work?_

I have some reservations about attending too much to the internal or technical operation of computational media. There's an ideologeme according to which you can't understand the work of digital media at a human level unless you also understand the operations of voltages, chips, cables, and code. As an erstwhile computer science major and somebody who writes a fair amount of code for my research, I really don't trust the priesthood of the coders to explain the operation of digital media to us.

That said, I do think that it's worth taking seriously the idea that computational media address us in ways that are not representational, and not organized by meaning.

The other aspect of Galloway's essay that I want to emphasize is the way his piece basically ends with a shrug. 294: "A new exploit is necessary, one that is as asymmetrical in relationship to distributed networks as the distributed network was to the power centers of modernity.... But this new exploit is never outside the network, is always formally within it..." He goes on to describe worms and viruses. But these do not an adequate political response make! "These techniques are not yet fully formed and in many cases are politically naïve if not retrograde." Basically, viruses are not a viable response.

There are a two aspects I want to draw out here:
* For Galloway, because the politics here isn't about _meaning_, the old political verities of modernism are no longer salient. In other words, critical theory is really good at working with meaning; it is less good at working with operation. But we need to learn how to think and work with non-representational media and how it operates beside or below meaning.
* But also: we don't yet have a sense of the political forms that will be adequate to the current moment. If ever the apparatus theory version of critique were adequate, it sure isn't anymore. The work is to develop an understanding of new forms of political analysis and response. (This should remind you of the Latour piece from last week.)

In various ways, the Cohen and the Fisher are responses to this particular impasse that Galloway ends with.

### Cohen, "Search Engine Subjectivities"
Cohen's primary target in this chapter--from his truly wonderful book, _Never Alone Except for Now_, which is to my mind the best work of media theory of the past five years--is the ways that search engines address us. He's an art historian by training, so he uses Thompson+Craighead's work _[Beacon](http://automatedbeacon.net)_ to unpack some of that.

For him, a "person" online--as addressed but also made up by search engines and other algorithmic advertising media--is not a psychologically or psychically integrated individual, but rather _a cluster of aggregated data_. 

This tracks a famous distinction from Gilles Deleuze, which comes in his very short "Postscript on Societies of Control," between the _individual_ and the _dividual_. An individual, etymologically, cannot be divided. The dividual, on the other hand, can be endlessly divided. Individuals persist over time with an identity, a single body, a psyche. Dvidiuals on the other hand, are clusters of data: able to be aggregated or disaggregated, subject to statistical manipulation. This essay is only 6 pages long, but it has been the governing essay for politically engaged digital media theory. And what, exactly, a dividual is has been the object of many exegeses and debates on the part of media theory people.

To understand Cohen's work, though, don't really need to understand what Deleuze means by the dividual. What we need to understand is: the conditions of contemporary life--technologically, but also politically--have changed so much that a whole new form of person comes into being: the dividual, or computational personhood.

Cohen's basic thought is that we still have to live as individuals--we still, after all, deal in meaning and have psyches and identities and the whole mess of human lives. But we are also always, at the same time, dividuals, addressed non-representationally by computers, treated as aggregations of data: a browsing history, a purchasing profile, a postal code, a credit score. We can't, not really, live our lives as these computational persons. But we nevertheless are such computational persons.

It's not in this particular chapter, but the basic idea is that, when we participate in life online, we are always both individuals and dividuals. We post on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and TikTok in ways that are about meaning, and identity. But we also are always--but without always knowing it or experiencing it--addressed by the machinery of ad tracking and behavior modification and data aggregation. We experience that side of things when we are served an ad that feels too intimate, or too directly tied to search histories. 

One of the creepier and more famous examples: The large US retailer Target figured out one of its teenage shoppers was pregnant, based on what she was buying. She was living with her parents. Before she told her father she was pregnant, Target sent coupons for pre-natal vitamins and diapers. He complained mightily to the store, and then had to apologize--once his daughter confessed to being pregnant.

But also: while watching the US version of _House of Cards_, I was delighted and curious about Kevin Spacey's rowing machine with the glass tank full of water. I searched it to find out. For the next year, Instagram kept trying to sell me a $12,000 rowing machine. (Dear reader, I did not buy a $12,000 rowing machine.)

For Cohen, dividuality hasn't replaced individuality. Instead, life online is marged by an unpredictable toggle or oscillation between the two forms. For the most part, our politics and our analysis and our theory still only know how to address individuality. In film theory, even when we're talking about the unconscious, it's with a theoretical framework--psychoanalysis--that's mostly concerned with complexities of individuals.

And so Cohen's figure of parrallelism: politics, and everyday life, now operate in two domains, which don't actually touch one another. And the political genres and analyses and programs we developed to deal with individuality, and meaning--and movies--do not reach the operation of algorithms and networks.

Cohen, 125:
> BEACON takes its referent, the search engine, and reverses its logic, introducing shards of defamiliarizing experience (by offering not the results but the queries; not our own, but an- other’s), as well as a kind of economic détournement whereby the opera- tive economic logics of search engines are literally bracketed out of the work: there are no ads, and we cannot make anything out of the results we see streaming past us, cannot add them up into a database, cannot mobilize and monetize that database toward the description of peoples, toward the subtle shaping of their persons. The avant-garde logic here would be that of the strikethrough: that which is undone by the artwork remains in the frame, only to be X’ed out, negated, rendered inoperative. The pedagogical lesson then adheres in the ongoing presence of that which is undone. This is a representational operation. It acquires its optimism only in the degree to which one is able to imagine that search engines’ most robust existence is in the mind of the user, as ideology. As such, the avant-garde procedure, in negating the ideology of search engines while showing us the devious persistence of that ideology, can goad us to think differently, and maybe teach us how to think differently, to make better representations and act on those instead.

But search engines _actually work_: they are not in the mind of a user. Not _logos_, but _ergon_.

### Fisher, "User Be Used"
Both Cohen and Galloway ultimately give us impasses: we do not yet know the genres of politics that could reach the operation of the computational networks that articulate our lives, that have material consequences, but address us outside or beyond or below our existence as individuals.

Fisher's lesson--an important one--is that there really are responses: those of the _parasite_. (She has a book forthcoming that argues this.)

Networks are necessarily hospitable: they are open to all who come. And, effectively, the logic of resistence here is for us to be bad guests. The worst guests possible. (One example: Occupy, from 2011. Very bad guests indeed.)

I don't find Fisher's prescriptions to be fully convincing--they still often are organized by a logic of disclosure: the parasite gives the lie to the host's openness, and thus we see how contemporary networks are bad. And once we see that... what?

But I think the biggest lesson she has is not for a particular politics, but rather a reorganization of the scale of politics. We're all already complicit in the operation of networked technologies, we are all always already dividuals, addressed in ways we don't understand by technologies we can't see. The important thing is not to recognize that, or to understand it, or even to critique that, but rather to engage in practices that disrupt some of that operation. It's the same thing Galloway argues, basically, but with a twist: our responses don't need to take down a whole system. We can't get outside of intensively computational neoliberal capitalism (my preferred abstraction cluster to name the present), but we can behave in ways that make its continued operation a little less frictionless. That's all we've got, but it's not nothing. 

And, perhaps more to the point, the practices that Fisher points to aren't viruses or worms, but rather artistic, activist, and conceptual practices that may or may not be especially computational. _Amazon Noir_ has a computational element, to be sure, but it's more about interrupting (in an admittedly small way!) the operation of a corporation that sees its customers as dividuals.

---

All of this really is to say, I really don't know what an adequate politics of the network would be. It's one of the things that I'm working on in my research. I do know that I despair when I think of working on the network as a whole. One of the resources I find in Fisher is a reorientation away from a politics in the large and towards a politics in the small that may not feel like it addresses all the terrible things happening in the world. But it can address, maybe, one or two of those things.

### "A Rape in Cyberspace," _I Love Alaska_, _Somebody_, _Beacon_
These works, in their ways, I deal with the impersonal, dividual address of networks. They're all delightful. I think the Dibbell is perhaps the most interesting for the forgeoing considerations, in that we very frequently mistake actors in networks to be people, or individuals. But that's often not the case! Despite Facebook's attempts to enforce single, "correct" identities for its users. _Somebody_ shows how the network address passes through identity and can reach through any-body-whatever. _I Love Alaska_ shows the profound partiality of a network's view of a person--and shows also how, when presented in human terms, still plays out as meaning, as narrative, as individuality. Cohen's reading of _Beacon_ is subtle and profound, but it is another way of giving us a network's-view of a person, while then also frustrating whatever tendencies towards individuality and meaning we may experience with _I Love Alaska_.

We need ways of seeing like a network. We don't have them, not really, not yet. These works are a start.

### Conclusion
I originally was going to write my gloss in CIN301 here. I am going to put it in [a seprate document](./2020-04-01-the_course.md).
