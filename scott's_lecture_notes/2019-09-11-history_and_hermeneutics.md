# On history and hermeneutics
CIN 301 lecture notes, Sept. 11, 2019

Hour 1:
* **More administration.**
  - Accessing readings
  - Accessing Scott’s notes
  - Accessing other course materials
  - On questions & discussions
  - A few ground rules for lectures: questions; calibrating participation; lead with not-understanding; I might interview you; I am not a mind-reader
  - What to do instead of staring at a slide deck
  - What admin/procedure/programming questions

* **Why history?**
  - Big question: why do we do the history of cinema?
  - Suspend/bracket Sobchack, Staiger, Gadamer. These are **your** answers.
  - Before we get to there: what do we do when we do the history of cinema?
  - Once we have a set of activities: why do we do these?
  - Why do I (Scott) do the history of cinema/media? A few different kinds of answers: (1) I really like reading Walter Benjamin (how did I come to get invested in the history of cinema); (2) I am trying to get a grasp on our current situation (history as helping us to learn the contours of the present); (3) the body of thought about cinema is the richest body of thought about the relationship between technology and experience (history as a tradition we inherit and use in our present)

* **Where are we starting?**
  - _What is happening in 1960 in the history of cinema?_ Some important answers: Hollywood & television; the re-establishment of European national cinema industries after the War and in reaction/relation to the Marshall Plan (esp. but not only France—1946 Blum-Byrnes agreement makes capital for rebuilding contingent on allowing American films to be shown in France); the first European New Waves (including in response to an influx of American films); the elaboration and institutionalization of international Art cinema (e.g., Cannes Film Festival is founded in 1946)
  - What is happening in 1960 in the world? Some important answers: post WWII reconstruction, and the economic boom in North America; the Cold War, and the recent and sharply intensified antagonisms between the US and the USSR; American cultural imperialism as a response (_coca-colonization_); the post-war unraveling of European colonialism (esp. British and French); new nationalist projects in post-colonial countries (and thus the establishment of national cinematic institutions as instruments of nation-building)
  - _What will happen in the 1960s?_ Some important answers: intensified global anti– and de-colonial struggles, including the American Civil Rights Movement and the rise and demise of the Black Panthers and the internationalization of decolonial struggles; the “sexual revolution” in Western countries that change sex and gender roles, leading to Second Wave feminism and the gay rights movements of the 1970s; the Vietnam War; intense political instability, including political assassinations in Western countries, complicated and turbulent relationships with the USSR and Eastern bloc countries, and violent conflicts in the post-colonies; a global anti-capitalist and anti-colonial student movement in 1968 that fails.

* **What is the ground for this unit of the course?**
  - In addition to the general history above, one particular site of historical investigation stands out: in many cases, the space of the theatre becomes charged. In Hollywood, as an economic response to the “threat” of television; in the New York underground, in ad-hoc exhibition spaces, including art galleries, bars, squats, etc., and also in illegal screenings of films deemed pornographic; in the Eastern bloc, as sites of a complex negotiation of cultural freedom and resistance; in the post-colony (including in the US and Canada), both a site of nation-building but also a space for illicit organizing in resistance to established colonizing powers.
  - We’re not watching it this year—I started with it last year—but _Psycho_ was the first Hollywood film to have a strict starting time; Hitchcock even required cinemas lock their doors when the film started
  - The films we are watching in this unit—from the New York Underground, from the Czech New Wave, from radical Latin American decolonial leftists, from Indigenous filmmakers in Canada—all, in various ways, put into question the site of reception: who is in the theatre; where is the theatre; what kind of public space is the theatre; what is the theatre as a space for aesthetic experience, political experience, their interrelation?
  - The target of our historical inquiry is in each case, in Gadamer’s terms, what we will call a _horizon of experience_. We can’t access that directly, so we have to do adventurous, conceptually risky work that constantly puts pressure on our own positions as historians

Second hour:

* **How do we think about the project of film history?**
  - What struck you from the reading?
  - Why, for any one of the authors, do we do history?
  - What was difficult for you in the reading?
  - Staiger, 127: “Of Lowenthal’s list, I tend to lean toward the last reason for producing histories…”
  - Sobchack, 302–303; 312; also e.g. 306: eco-criticism (cf. Hunter Vaughan, Brian Jacobson, Jennifer Fay)
  - Gadamer, 100–101

Break.

Remainder:

* Films & discussion: might films do the “history of cinema?”
* Questions for tutorial: ask genuine, vulnerable questions: what didn’t you understand about the reading? The films? Remember: this is the part where you start taking responsibility for the questions that drive your engagement with the material.
