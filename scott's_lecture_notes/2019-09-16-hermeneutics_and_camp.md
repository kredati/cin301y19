# Hermeneutics and Camp
#### September 16, 2019

### Logistics
* If you're planning on seeking accommodations of any kind during the year, you should make an appointment immediately to see me. I would prefer to avoid a traffic jam when we're working on the first paper.
* To come see me in office hours, the first thing to do is to book an appointment at https://calendly.com/s-richmond/officehours
* If my hours are booked or you can't make Tuesday afternoons, write me an email telling me that. (If you ask for an appointment without telling me that, my first response will be: book a slot during regular hours.)
* Also also: please do not email me if you are going to miss lecture; please do not email your TA if you are going to miss tutorial. There's nothing we can do about it and it takes up bandwidth in our communications channels. You have everything you need to make up the material.
* Finally, there will be climate actions on this upcoming Friday, and a week from. This Friday, there is a teach-in. I encourage everybody to attend. There is a general strike on Friday, Sept. 27—I will be striking as well. There will be a demonstration at Queen's Park, in front of the Ontario parliament building, starting at 11am. I encourage all to come. In addition, I encourage you all to strike that day (whatever that might mean for you). And, as both the teach-in and the strike are during Friday tutorials, I'm working with Patrick to devise a system where you can attend one or both actions without penalty.
* What logistical questions do you have?

### Recapping last week
* Lots of great questions in tutorials this week; they didn't get addressed/discussed
* Keep bringing good questions; we'll keep working on "good"
* What we said:
  - We have a model of hermeneutics that organizes how we're going to do film history
  - Q: What seem like the most salient features of hermeneutics?
  - Pre-understanding, departure from self into acts of "interpretation" (more on what that might mean today)—description, analysis, research, conversation—and a return to a newly-transformed self
  - Also: a kind of history that is organized by our desire to know: what Gadamer calls "wanting to understand" and what Sobchack calls "desire": history is a history of the present

* What you asked about: wanting to understand Gadamer better (yay!—I _love_ Gadamer but always worry he'll be boring to students); wanting to discuss _Passage à l'acte_ better; wanting to talk about Sobchack. Sobchack will come back today when I talk about Osterweil.
* What questions do you want to talk about with Arnold? What questions do you have?

### Notes on camp
Three main contexts for the work we're talking about:
1. The development of "sensibility" as a target for historical research. What is a sensibility? How do you grasp it? Why does it matter? And how does this fit into the hermeneutic project?
2. A point that these films come out of a world where film was only one practice among many. Warhol is most famous as a painter. How do we do the history of these films that connects them to the broader aesthetic horizons of 1963?
3. Larger socio-political context of the "Underground": 1963 as still belonging to the "long 1950s." What kinds of resistance and opposition do we see here?

The question we'll defer till Wednesday is how these questions can help us organize our encounter with these films.

Today, I'll take each in turn.

### Sensibility
#### What is a sensibility?
* Sontag, 276

#### What is a _camp_ sensibility?
* Note 8, 279: "things-being-what-they-are-not"
* Note 10, 280: "being-as-playing-a-role"
* Note 16 & 17, 281: doubleness of camp
* Note 36, 287: "the sensibility of failed seriousness, of the theatricalization of experience"

### Larger aesthetic context
* If you read the entry in _OH_, you'll note the big historical sweep of American experimental film: psychodrama to structural to dissolution in the face of video
* In 1963 we're at the inflection point bt. interiority and structure
* In art practice across media, the elaboration of techniques to get away from art-as-expression
* Andy Warhol, _Campbell's Soup Cans_ (1962)
* Rothko, _Untitled_ (1963)
* John Cage, _4'33"_
* What differences do you see between these?
* Sontag, "Against Interpretation": 14
* Cage, "Experimental Music": 10, 12

### Larger political context
* Return to doubleness
* Downtown New York City in 1963
* Not-yet-gay-not-yet-queer; homophobia and the necessity of hiding, but also, this is before the widespread stabilization of sexual identity
* Osterweil, 27–29: A world that is lost, that we are trying to recover
* So this might count as "queer cinema" (that's why we're watching it)—but it wasn't that at the time
* Sontag "defends" _Flaming Creatures_; why?
