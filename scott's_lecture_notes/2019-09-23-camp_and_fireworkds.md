# Camp and Fireworks
## Sontag and Lyotard

### Logistics
* Again, climate strike this Friday, 11am at Queen's Park. If you're in Friday's tutorial, Patrick has communicated with you.
* Again, apologies for our technical difficulties last Wednesday, but thanks for the Warhol screening

### On last week
Before I get very far:
* One of the questions from tutorial: what about blackface? This is a super important question
* Important resources here: [1619 on "the Birth of American Music"](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-3-the-birth-of-american-music/id1476928106?i=1000448861139) and [PBS documentary on race, melodrama, and minstrelsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3K9uKIMob0&app=desktop)
* What we have here isn't blackfaceâ€”which is important as a specific function and tradition
* Flaming Creatures: not blackface but bad filmmaking
* Christmas on Earth: not blackface but modernist primitivism, which is still totally racist, but in a more mediated way
* While holding onto its racism, we should also point out it serves as an alibi for queer underground sexual cultures to put their illicit and illegal acts onscreen

* Also on last week: camp is not a category! I think we go this, but it's important to avoid categorical thinking here

* Questions

### On this week:
* Narrative vs attraction; meaning vs. surface; substance vs. style; figures of doubleness: camp, allegory.
* These are historically grounded but also approaches to reading, interpretation
* Lyotard gives us some inkling of how to think about this doubleness, drawing out both poles: 54, 55, 56
* We'll get to the Lim and Zalman next time
