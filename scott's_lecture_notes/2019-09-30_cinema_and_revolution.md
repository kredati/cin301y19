# Cinema and Revolution

### Logistics
* Your papers will be due October 25: there's plenty of time. But you'll get prompts soon, a week from today.
* Last year's prompts are available on Quercus as a general guide; we will be writing new prompts for this year. Some of them will overlap; some will not.

### Last week: more on acinema
* Many questions about the details of acinéma, and Lyotard in particular.
* What did we say about acinema? What do you understand?
* Retread of close reading from last weekl. Lyotard: 54 ([im]mobility); 55 (psychic integration; gloss psychoanalysis); 56 (identification with capital and the production of subjectivity); 57 (cinema as the exclusion of expenditure); 59 (jouissance and theatricality)
* What further questions do you have?

### This week: cinema and revolution
* We're continuing to ship away at the big question: what can you do in a cinema?
* One answer: get radicalized
* We have two films this week: Santiago Alvarez's _Now_ and Solanas and Gettino's _Hour of the Furnaces_.
* They are both examples of what Solanas and Gettino call "Third Cinema."
* What do we mean by Third Cinema? (A _decolonial_ cinema.)
* And so, let's return to a question we asked last week: what was happening in the world in the 1960s? —A major, important answer: decolonial movements, and (post)colonial wars.
* Historical context (from separate sheet)
