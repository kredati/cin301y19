# _La hora de los hornos_ and _Now_

### But first...
Let's catch up to ourselves. I understand one or two of you are maybe feeling a bit lost. To give us some orientation, here's where we are and what we're doing:
* De-stabilizing film. (Other aesthetic forms)
* Undermining the analytical and interpretive procedures honed on mainstream and classical film. (Experimental film)
* Complicating historical inquiry. (Hermeneutics, but then also: whose history?)
* Pulling our awareness toward the cinematic encounter. (Theatricality)

### _Now_
* Santiago Alvarez, _Now_, Cuba, 1965
* Reverses the historical gaze: it's the "margin" looking back at the "centre."
* Experimentalism in Cuban documentary: Cuba in the 60s was freer than the Eastern bloc countries, even as it was supported by the USSR.
* There's still a question of political correctness; but _Now_, as revolutionary documentary looking at the US, is obviously not about Fidel, pro or con.
* Most obvious aesthetic precursor: Soviet film from the 20s (Eisenstein & Vertov)

### _Hour of the Furnaces_
* Solanas & Gettino, _La hora de los hornos_, 1966, Argentina
* Film was shot in secret, had to be smuggled to Venezuela for developing, screened in secret.
* Multiple-media: lecture, some performance, discussion
