# Fourth Cinema & history; Cinema of the 60s

### Catching us up
* Logistics: today we'll talk about _Knud Rasmussen_, recap this unit of the course, and talk about writing
* I'll defer questions about papers until the writing portion of our time together
* I have noted that I haven't put links up for the next unit; the reading is there, but I will add links later today
* Also: Cavell's _The World Viewed_ has finally arrived at the bookstore; please buy your copies before end of fall term. I will remind you.

### Knud Rasmussen and history
* Show last segment, into credits: emphasize history, what are the ways history is put onscreen here?
* What did you see?
* Registers of historical telling in this film: framing narration at beginning; diegetic narration, the journal itself as a diegetic and extradiegetic archive, oral histories of the Inuit, photographs
* In this moment, note direct transition from re-enactment (of a spiritual reality!) up against photographs, or colonial technologies of archives and capture (& alignment with film & video?)
* Eyeline matching and focalization in this sequence: we see Avva's spirit helpers without Avva in frame—for the first time I believe
* Diegetically, there's no difference between characters and spirit helpers, except for "continuity errors": what do we make of this?
* Is this allegory? (Avva giving up his spirit guides = Inuit giving up their traditional lifeworld; Avva as the last great shaman, and we see his rejection of that, under duress)
* Allegory, of course, is an act of interpretation: who are the audiences for this film? (cf. Krupat); But then: who are the agents of this colonial conversion? What are the white people doing here? (cf. Rasmussen's desire for northern nations to stay out of history, to be preserved "as they have always been")
* Recap: 4th cinema: a cinema not tied to the nation-state, a cinema whose politics is not evangelical and does not seek conversion, a cinema whose politics means questioning or challenging the very terms of colonialist history (tied to the nation-state and the archival techniques of colonialism), a cinema whose institutional forms put into question of "cinema"—but which does not challenge or seek to dismantle the nation-state

### Cinema, resistance, interpretation
* What are the big takeaways from this unit?
* Mine:
  - Interpretation has to move off the screen and into the audience
  - There are many ways this can happen
  - In the 1960s, this is tied to the a certain democratization of film production, connected to the proliferation of new technologies, esp. 16mm synch sound film; but it is also tied to the rise of TV and a crisis in the cinema
  - Cinema gets political in this period (in myriad ways) by getting _theatrical_: it reaches out to audiences, it invests the cinema as an aesthetically and politically charged space
  - This theatricalization is not fully divorced from the "film itself", the literal image; it names instead a relation between image and theatre, organized by the film but completed by the audience and its activity
  - To study this theatricalization, we must respond to it, become aware of it, come alive to it: that means writing history (aesthetic, political, and otherwise) from a position that acknowledges our own position. The name for the tradition that acknowledges our position is _hermeneutics_.
  - This is not the only story we could tell about cinema in the 1960s! But even a film history that picks out a country and finds a representative film is a choice, not a natural fact of doing the history of film: all histories, we learn from hermeneutics, are interested histories.
* What are we going to get going forward?
  - We will find a tradition of theorists, in the 1970s, that will turn the theatricalization of film in the 60s into a theoretical problem: their particular interest will be in theorizing the encounter or relation between viewer and film.
  - The problem of film theory of the 70s, "apparatus theory", will be to find a descriptive vocabulary that articulates this encounter, describes its force and importance.
  - The problem we will have, simply beyond explaining this abstruse body of thought to ourselves (which is challenging on its own), will be to understand how this body of thought is in history, responding to particular conditions and problems: we will attempt to historicize the film theory we read, even while it pretends to be general or universal in its description.
