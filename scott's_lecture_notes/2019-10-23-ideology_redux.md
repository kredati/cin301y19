# Ideology, again
## In the classroom and in cinema

### What is ideology?
* What did we say last time?
* Exercise: what do you know is going to happen in a class?
  - You get a mark.
  - High marks are good.
  - Marks express the work you do in a course. (Why don't we like group work?)
  - The instructor knows what they're talking about.
  - The instructor is credentialed.
  - The instructor has authority.
  - You should pay attention.
  - You should comport yourself properly.
  - You will learn something.
  - "Learning something" will be measured.
  - Learning is a thing that can be measured.
  - Etc.
* Remember the basic exploration of ideology: how people come to desire their own domination/exploitation. How does school prepare you for that?
* One way to approach ideology: Althusser's direct theorization of it
  - Abstract theorization: 106, 109, 111â€“12
  - But 112: the material existence of ideology
* Thus ideological _apparatuses_
  - What are these? (cf 96)
  - What does it mean to understand the cinema as an ideological apparatus?
  - In other words, how does cinema teach us to desire our own domination?
  - cf. Solanas and Gettino, p. 4
* We'll have to put off something of the Baudry until Monday, but what might this mean for politicized filmmaking?
