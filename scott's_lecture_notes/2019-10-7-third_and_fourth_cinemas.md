# Third and Fourth Cinemas

### Logistics
* We have a paper due! October 25, 11:59pm, with a grace period until I wake up on Saturday. (Saturday is my one day a week to sleep in. I leave it to your imaginations when that might be.)
* Draw attention to: prompts, rubric.
* I will tell you this now, and then I will tell you again, and then I will tell you again, and still many of you will forget: the numerical score you will receive on your paper _is not_ a percentage score like you usually get at U of T. The numerical score converts to a letter mark, which will then be reconverted into a normal U of T score. To wit, a 6/10 is not a 60. It is a B, which is actually a 75.
* A few general notes:
  - Work on what interests you. Have a motivation for _why_ you are writing the paper you are writing, and _communicate that motivation to your reader_.
  - The watchword is specificity. We are going to do work in our writing workshops to get you as specific as possible. We will also spend some time thinking about how to connect that specific work to larger questions.
  - Do _not_ start your papers with generalizations.
  - We're going to be thinking a _lot_ about readers. The most important things to work on, as you work on your paper, is to address _what you would like to teach your reader_ and _why you think it is important_. Then, communicate those plainly and clearly.

### Third Cinema
* Big question: what is Third Cinema?
* But let's drill down, and get more careful.
* Stam and Shohat call their category "Third Worldist" film. What is the Third World?
* What do Fernando Solanas and Octavio Gettino mean by Third Cinema? (p. 4)
* What kind of a category is Third Cinema for Solanas and Gettino? What do they use that term to _do_ (rather than, maybe, to mean)?
* Cinema and the nation: cinema's obvious unit of inquiry is the nation. (cf. the TOC of the _Oxford History_). Why might this be? Why might counter-national cinemas (Third, Fourth) cinemas come into being in the late 1960s?
* What is the political project of _Hour of the Furnaces_ or _Now_?

### Fourth Cinema
* What, then, is Fourth Cinema?
* cf. Nagib, 31.
* Compare: _Hour of the Furnaces_, Solanas and Gettino, Fanon: Third Cinema is a nation-making cinema.
* Barclay, 1, 7, 9â€“10
* Fourth Cinema is a cinema without a nation-state.
* Third Cinema is a cinema enlisted into the project of making a new nation state.
* Thus we can see why Fourth Cinema is not threatening to the nations: Canada and Denmark financed _Atanarjuat, The Fast Runner_ and _The Journals of Knud Rasmussen_; Argentina banned _Hour of the Furnaces_ and it's still hard to see.
