### On psychoanalysis
* Invented by Freud in the late 19th century; starts as an attempt to cure "hysterics"
* It's messy: Freud told many different stories at different moments in time for different purposes (case studies, theories, etc.)
* The very basics: for Freud, as for all others, apparent normality is achieved. (Recall the mirror stage.) This is not just about psychic integration, but also desire.
* Psychoanalysis, fundamentally, tells stories about the development of desire: its origins, its channeling, its fundamental perversity. The takeaway: we're all fundamentally perverse; any apparent normalcy is achieved, and could go wrong at any moment (cf. "Fetishism")
* So let's tell the story about castration. (Tell the castration stories.)
* Question: what do we make of this? (It's obviously bullshit.)
* So why might feminists and queers want to use it to think with? (It affirms the non-normativity of desire; it tells stories of how normative gender is achieved and might go wrong, be renegotiated.)
* How can we make it feel like less bullshit? (Existentialize it, Ã  la Lacan.)
